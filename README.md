# Simmon-Game-
The Simon game is a memory skill game where players must replicate a sequence of colors and sounds. Each round, the game adds a new color to the sequence, which the player must remember and repeat in the correct order. The game continues to challenge the player's memory by increasing the length of the sequence with each successful replication.
